        <h3 class="subtitle">Client Modifications: Meeting One</h3>
        <p class="words">
            1. Could we change the color of the buttons? The greyed out buttons make them look unclickable.
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            2. How do you define and achieve efficiency?
        <p class="words">
            3. Will you do a search bar? If so, how?
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            4. How will students "favorite" classes before registering?        
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Client Modifications: Meeting Two</h3>
        <p class="words">
            1. UI looks good. Still concerned about the clarity of the buttons.
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            2. Why did you decide to remove waitlisting?
        <p class="words">
            3. Are you still on schedule? What have you fallen behind on?
        </p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">Client Modifications: Meeting Three</h3>
        <p class="words">
            1. Will you be implementing a search bar when searching for classes?
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            2. It is a little unclear which tab you are currently on. Could you opt for a third color instead of blue and grey?
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            3. When/how does the semester change (ie current and future semester)?
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            4. Why have static drop down for course level? Why not just type in exact course number?
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            5. Can teachers enroll in classes other than their own?
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            6. Do teachers have entirely separate accounts?
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            7. Are teachers able to enroll students in their classes? Where would that happen?
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            8. Are there any other requirements that will need to be edited?
        </p>
        <h3 class="subtitle">Requirements Added by Client</h3>
        <p class="words">
            1. Each modification to classes or schedules needs to be auditable. This should include a timestamp for anytime that a class is created or modified, a student is registered or unregistered from a class, and a user identification for who performed the change.
        </p>
        <p class="words">
            2. The current semester shall have a defined end (whether by date or manual), and any courses that a student is "currently" enrolled in should be moved to a history and the next semester shall start.
        </p>
