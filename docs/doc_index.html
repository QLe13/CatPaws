        <h3 class="subtitle">Project Description</h3>
        <p class="words">
            The objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly and efficient software solution for class registration in a higher education environment. Our focus is to deliver a lightweight and reliable service that fulfills our clientâ€™s specific requirements without adding unnecessary features that can complicate the user experience.
            We will draw inspiration from existing registration services such as TigerPaws from Trinity University and Skyward from Texas public schools. However, we will avoid common issues identified in these applications, such as unintuitive interfaces, feature bloat, and frustrating quirks that slow down or confuse users.
            Our main goal is to create a straightforward software that simplifies the registration process and helps students navigate through their course selection with ease. We aim to reduce stress and frustration during the hectic time of class registration by providing a seamless and intuitive user experience.
